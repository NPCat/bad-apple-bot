# Bad Apple Bot
A discord bot that sends discord messages in the shape of bad apple.

# Installation
1. **Make sure to get Python 3.8 or higher**
2. **Create directory for code**

Simply run `git clone https://github.com/NPCat/bad-apple-bot` in a command prompt.

3. **Install dependencies**

This is `pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

4. **Setup Configuration**

Go into `bad apple discord player.py` and scroll to the bottom line. Put your discord bot's discord token in. If you don't know where your token is, consider google :)

Go into the discord dev portal and turn on the Message Content Intent.

Finally, go into `video to frames.py` and run it. **This will take about a minute depending on your computer, just be patient.**
